## Status

API is stable.

## Import this library in your project

```cmd
go get github.com/go-openapi/runtime
```


## Change log

See <https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/releases>

For pre-v0.30.0 releases see [release notes](docs/NOTES.md).

**What coming next?**

Moving forward, we want to :

* [ ] continue narrowing down the scope of dependencies:
  * yaml support in an independent module
  * introduce more up-to-date support for opentelemetry as a separate module that evolves
    independently from the main package (to avoid breaking changes, the existing API
    will remain maintained, but evolve at a slower pace than opentelemetry).
* [ ] fix a few known issues with some file upload requests (e.g. #286)
